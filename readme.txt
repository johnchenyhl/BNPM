##Requests: 
  * Please don't use this code for commercial applications without asking first.
  * If you publish results using this code, please cite Automatic structural regularities exploration in complex networks 
  * Please feel free to contact me for feedback and bug fixes.

Contents: this folder contains basic functions needed for BNPM to run.

Please read the "Automatic structural regularities exploration in complex networks" paper.

##Algorithm notes:
  * Code should be correct but is not heavily optimised. 
  * Samples are considered in a random order within each iteration to avoid ordering bias in the data.

##Usage:
  * Run runBNPM.m 
  * Adapt load_settings.m to your needs.  

The code seems to work. No promises about bugs though. Please let me know about bugs you may find and I will try to fix them.

Input file: *.tuple

Such as karate.tuple

```
34
1	2
1	3
```

"34" denotes the node number, "1	2" denotes an edge from node 1 to 2. Notice that the node id should be consecutive numbers from 1 to N.

Output file: BNPM-*.txt

The partition group of each nodes.

Golden file: *.txt

The golden partition group of each nodes.
